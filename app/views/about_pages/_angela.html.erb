            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Angela’s passion for working with animals and rescue began as a child;
            which led her to joining FFA in 7th grade where she gained hands on experience working
            with stock dogs. Her interest in animal behavior and welfare only grew from there. While
            attaining a degree in Diagnostic Medical Sonography, the passion never ceased and in 2011
            she decided to move from WV to NC and establish a new career path in professional dog
            training and boarding. After mentoring under established dog trainers and managing a high
            volume boarding and daycare facility to learn more, her thirst for knowledge has only grown.

          <p class="mt-4">
            &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp After connecting with these other dog community creators, she created a
            video discussing how government offices could never do the job the right way to where it
            would actually make a difference. This video would lead to the dawn of a new ERA in which
            ethical rescues hold each other accountable and educate the public about Animal Welfare,
            with the goals of fighting back against Animal Rights Activism and putting the animals'
            humane care over human desires.
